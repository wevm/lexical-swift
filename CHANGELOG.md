# Changelog

Each release names the upstream Lexical version it conforms to. The release
workflow publishes the section headed `## <swift/VERSION>`.

## Unreleased

- Core model: nodes, editor, updates and transforms, commands and listeners,
  selection, NodeState, slots, carets, and byte-exact legacy and compact JSON.
- Serialization schemas: `arrayValue`, `arraySetValue`, `objectValue`,
  `unionValue` and `transformValue`, with `accepts` and union member
  selection as in JS. Schema declarations JS refuses now throw, so
  `config()` is `throws`.
